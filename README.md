# XenaVersio

Dynamic Stochastic Synthesis oscillator for the [Noise Engineering Versio](https://noiseengineering.us/pages/world-of-versio) platform.

Based on the DSS algorithm developed by composer Iannis Xenakis, XenaVersio generates evolving waveforms through controlled random walks—breakpoints wander within boundaries, creating timbres that morph organically while maintaining coherent pitch.

## Features

- 2–16 configurable breakpoints
- First-order, second-order (GENDY3), and correlated walk modes
- Three frequency ranges (LFO to audio rate)
- V/Oct tracking with calibration
- Full CV control over all parameters
- Stereo output with subtle random bias for width
